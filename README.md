ProcilLa is a simple project developed to make it easier to analyze and interpret CSV files exported from ProcMon in a more visual and user-friendly way. It includes OpenAI integration, allowing selected events to be analyzed and interpreted via OpenAI.

Note: It is developed to assist analysts during the malware analysis process, but it is not sufficient on its own for complete malware analysis, and AI may make mistakes. For critical analysis cases, additional static and dynamic analyses should be performed using tools such as Ghidra and x64dbg to validate the event flow.
